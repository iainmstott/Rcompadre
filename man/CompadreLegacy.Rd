\title{Subsample of a legacy version of the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database for
testing and examples}
\format{A list with four elements:

\strong{metadata} - A data frame with the following 47 columns:
\itemize{
\item SpeciesAuthor - Binomial species name given by the paper's author
\item SpeciesAccepted - Accepted binomial species name taken from \emph{The Plant
List} or \emph{Catalogue of Life}
\item CommonName - Common name for species used in the publication
\item Genus - Taxonomic genus that the accepted species belongs to
\item Family - Family that the species belongs to
\item Order - Order that the species belongs to
\item Class - Class that the species belongs to
\item Phylum - Phylum that the species belongs to
\item Kingdom - Kingdom that the species belongs to
\item OrganismType - Organism type (see COMPADRE User Guide for documentation)
\item DicotMonoc - Whether the species is a dicot or monocot. Non-angiosperms are
\code{NA}.
\item AngioGymno - Whether the species is an angiosperm or gymnosperm. Non-plants
are \code{NA}.
\item Authors - Last name of all authors (separated with ";")
\item Journal - Abbreviated journal title, or type of source document (e.g. "PhD
thesis")
\item YearPublication - Year of publication
\item DOI.ISBN - Digital Object Identifier or International Standard Book Number
codes to identify each publication
\item AdditionalSource - Additional source(s) used to reconstruct the matrix or
obtain additional metadata for the matrix (if applicable)
\item StudyDuration - Number of years of observation in study (\code{StudyEnd - StudyStart})
\item StudyStart - Study start year
\item StudyEnd - Study end year
\item AnnualPeriodicity - Inverse of the length of the projection interval (in
years)
\item NumberPopulations - The number of study populations as defined by the
authors. Within site replication of permanent plots is not defined as
separate populations
\item MatrixCriteriaSize - Indicates whether the matrix contains stages based on
size. If so, indicates what that measure of size is
\item MatrixCriteriaOntogeny - Indicates whether the matrix contains stages based
on ontogenic/developmental stages
\item MatrixCriteriaAge - Indicates whether the matrix contains stages based on
age
\item MatrixPopulation - Population name or definition of where the matrix was
recorded, usually given by the author. See COMPADRE User Guide.
\item Lat - Latitude in decimal degrees
\item Lon - Longitude in decimal degrees
\item Altitude - Altitude of study site (m above sea level)
\item Country - 3-letter ISO country code for the country in which the study took
place (multiple countries separated with ";")
\item Continent - Continent on which study took place
\item Ecoregion - Ecoregion in which study took place. See COMPADRE User Guide.
\item StudiedSex - Whether study included only males ("M"), only females ("F"),
or both sexes ("M/F")
\item MatrixComposite - Indicates the type of matrix population model. Possible
values are \code{Individual}, \code{Mean}, \code{Pooled}, and \code{Seasonal}. See COMPADRE
User Guide.
\item MatrixTreatment - Describes if a treatment was applied to the population or
not. If yes, includes a brief description of the treatment. If not,
\code{Unmanipulated}
\item MatrixCaptivity - Whether species was studied in the wild (\code{W}), captivity
(\code{C}), or captured from a wild population (\code{CW})
\item MatrixStartYear - First year of matrix
\item MatrixStartSeason - First season of matrix as described by author
(hemisphere-specific)
\item MatrixStartMonth - First month of matrix
\item MatrixEndYear - Final year of matrix
\item MatrixEndSeason - Final season of matrix as described by author
(hemisphere-specific)
\item MatrixEndMonth - Final month of matrix
\item MatrixSplit - Whether the \strong{A} matrix has been split into components
\strong{U}, \strong{F}, and \strong{C} ("Divided") or not ("Indivisible"). If not,
elements of \code{matU}, \code{matF}, and \code{matC} are filled with \code{NA}
\item MatrixFec - Whether fecundity was measured for the matrix model
\item Observation - Additional observations recorded by database compilers
\item MatrixDimension - Dimension of the \strong{A} matrix
\item SurvivalIssue - Denotes the maximum stage-specific survival value
}

\strong{mat} - A list of population projection models, which are also
in list format. Each list element contains four matrices:
\itemize{
\item matA - A matrix population model
\item matU - The survival- and growth-related component of matA
\item matF - The sexual reproduction component of matA
\item matC - The clonal reproduction component of matA
}

\strong{matrixClass} - A list of data frames, each with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item MatrixClassOrganized - Standardized stage class of the matrix population
model
\item MatrixClassAuthor - Stage description from the original publication
\item MatrixClassNumber - Integer stage number
}

\strong{version} - A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item Version - The version number of the database
\item DateCreated - The date that the \code{.RData} file was created
\item NumberAcceptedSpecies - The number of accepted species in the original
version
\item NumberStudies - The number of studies in the original version
\item NumberMatrices - The number of matrices in the original version
\item Agreement - Link to the COMADRE license agreement
