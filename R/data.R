#' @description 
#' `Compadre` (plant matrices) and `Comadre` (animal matrices) are subsamples of
#' the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and COMADRE Animal Matrix Database,
#' respectively, that are used for testing and examples. Each object is of class
#' 'CompadreDB' and therefore has the following two slots: `data` and `version`.
